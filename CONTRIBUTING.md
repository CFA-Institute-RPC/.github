# CONTRIBUTING
First of all, thank you for taking the time to contribute (or at least read the Contributing Guidelines)! ðŸš€

RPC Labs provides anyone with relevant and trusted financial tools for free. To achieve this, the CFA Institute relies on community involvement to update, edit, and remove contributions over time. This is made easy enough so that anyone, even those with little coding experience, can participate.

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to the RPC Labs. They are meant to guide you through how updating the repositories works and how you can contribute with little coding background as well.

These are just a few examples but feel free to proceed how you'd like! **Any help is much appreciated!**

# Advanced (Developers)
If you know your way around Git and GitHub this is the preferred way of providing updates. In any case, I still provide information regarding how to set up Git.

## Working with Git & Pull Requests

Any new contribution preferably goes via a Pull Request. In essence, all you really need is Git and a basic understanding of how a Pull Request works. Find some resources that explain this well here:

- [Finding ways to contribute to open source on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/finding-ways-to-contribute-to-open-source-on-github)
- [Set up Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git)
- [Collaborating with pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests)


## Following the Workflow

After setting up Git, you can fork and pull the project in.

1. Fork the Project ([more info](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo))
    - **Using GitHub Desktop:** [Getting started with GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop) will guide you through setting up Desktop. Once Desktop is set up, you can use it to [fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop)!
    - **Using the command line:** [Fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository) so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you're ready to merge them.
2. Pull the Repository Locally ([more info](https://github.com/git-guides/git-pull))
2. Create your own branch (`git checkout -b feature/contribution`)
3. Add your changes (`git add .`)
4. Commit your Changes (`git commit -m 'Improve the Project'`)
5. Push to your Branch (`git push origin feature/contribution`)
6. Open a Pull Request
